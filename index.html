			Hi! My name is Jessica, I am a full time grad student who loves to travel when I have the time. I created this blog to document all of the trips I have taken and to share my experiences with my fellow travellers!

			Growing up, my family loved to travel. Whenever we had a break from school my parents would take my brother and I somewhere. My favorite trip we took when I was younger was a road trip to Disney World. We went with my uncle and his family, and drove from Arkansas. It was so much fun to spend time with my family that did not live nearby.

			Now, I love to travel with my friends. We started travelling together while we were in undergrad. Taking weekend trips to Miami, Chicago, or longer trips like to Costa Rica. Currently, we all live in different states, so we try to take trips every couple months to visit each other and explore each others new homes!

			I am so excited to create this blog and document all of my travels. Come along with me as I learn about the unique history and culture of each place I visit! And, don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter!
