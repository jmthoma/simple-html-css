		<p>"Friendly and food-obsessed, hedonistic and historic, cultured and curious, Thailand tempts visitors with a smile as golden as the country's glittering temples and tropical beaches."</p>
		<p> I have been dreaming of visiting Thailand FOR EVER! And, I have finally made plans to go Summer 2024, with my siblings. Even though its 2 years away I have already started planning our travel itinerary. Below are some of the places and food we HAVE to visit/try while there.</p>

					<p class="description">Thai food is my favorite cuisine, I can't wait to try all of the authentic dishes. Including fresh fish. Thailand has over 3,000 kilometres of coastline and calm seas. The fishing industry is extremelly important to Thailand, as not only does it help feed the nation but also economically supports the country."</p>

					<p class="description">Doi Inthanon National Park is one of the most popular national parks in Thailand. "The park is named in honour of the king Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who was concerned about the forests in the north of Thailand and wanted to preserve it. After his death his remains were placed in the park as he ordered and the forest was renamed to Doi Inthanon."</p>

					<p class="description">I love elephants! They are my spirit animal, and in Thailand they have an Elephant Nature Park. "Elephant Nature Park is a unique project set in Chiang Mai province, Northern Thailand. Established in the 1990’s [thier] aim has always been to provide a sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants. The park is located some 60km from the city, and has provided a sanctuary for dozens of distressed elephants from all over Thailand."</p>
