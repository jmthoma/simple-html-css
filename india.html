		<p>"With its sumptuous mix of traditions, spiritual beliefs, festivals, architecture and landscapes, your memories of India will blaze bright long after you've left its shores."</p>
		<p> Growing up, I would visit India with my family every couple of years. This was my first solo trip to India and was such a unique experience. If you have the opportunity to take a solo-trip somewhere I highly recommend it!</p>

				<p class="description">Traditional Indian food, what I look forward to most when visiting. "Indian cuisine is a scrumptious smorgasbord of regionally distinct recipes, each with their own traditional preparation techniques and presentation styles â€“ from the competing flavours of masterfully marinated meats and thalis (plate meals) to the simple splendour of vegetarian curries and deep-sea delights."</p>

				<p class="description">I love Indian food because of the complex flavors and spices. "Spices lie at the heart of Indian cooking, with the crackle of cumin seeds in hot oil a familiar sound in most kitchens. The country is also renowned for its tempting array of street food, with vendors selling everything from spicy samosas and kebabs to cooling kulfi (ice cream) and lassi (yoghurt drink)."</p>

				<p class="description">A beautiful site! It was so interesting to learn the history of the Taj Mahal. "The Taj was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. The death of Mumtaz left the emperor so heartbroken that his hair is said to have turned grey virtually overnight. Construction of the Taj began the following year; although the main building is thought to have been built in eight years, the whole complex was not completed until 1653."</p>
